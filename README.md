Full-stack developer working mostly in **TypeScript**: Next.js and React on the front, Node/Express and Supabase/Postgres or MongoDB behind it, deployed on Vercel and Cloudflare. I like shipping things people can actually open and use, and I contribute fixes to open-source projects I learn from.

**Portfolio:** [jeevan2410.github.io/Portfolio](https://jeevan2410.github.io/Portfolio/)

## Open-source contributions

Merged:

- **[libredb/libredb-studio#1522](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/pull/1522)**: MongoDB whole-database Validate and Compact no longer crash on views; time series collections are handled and per-collection failures are reported (verified on MongoDB 7.0, 8.0 and 8.2).
- **[libredb/libredb-studio#1554](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/pull/1554)**: MongoDB schema inference and the data profiler count fields missing from some documents as nullable.
- **[libredb/libredb-studio#1556](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/pull/1556)**: Monitoring labels a Percona Server correctly instead of calling it MySQL.
- **[libredb/libredb-studio#1561](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/pull/1561)**: running a selected statement in the editor drops its trailing terminator on engines that take none, such as Oracle and Elasticsearch.
- **[libredb/libredb-studio#1562](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/pull/1562)**: LibreDB connections refuse `:memory:` and name a missing directory clearly.
- **[libredb/libredb-studio#1571](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/pull/1571)**: ClickHouse, Druid, libSQL and Couchbase name the refusal and the address when a server cannot be reached, instead of "fetch failed".
- **[libredb/libredb-studio#1595](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/pull/1595)**: CockroachDB functions and procedures no longer offer an Edit that every apply refused; the provider measures at connect whether the server runs the edit guard (verified on CockroachDB v26.3.2 and PostgreSQL 18.6).
- **[lingui/js-lingui#2703](https://github.com/lingui/js-lingui/pull/2703)**: the Vite plugin's native macro transform no longer fails on module ids with a query string (React Router framework mode).

Shipped in a release: [reticle#1402](https://github.com/reticlehq/reticle/pull/1402), an absent check on a hidden element names `state: hidden` ([Reticle 3.6.0](https://github.com/reticlehq/reticle/releases/tag/v3.6.0)).

In review: [corsair#1847](https://github.com/corsairdev/corsair/pull/1847).
